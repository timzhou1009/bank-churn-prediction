This document was created on: 11/24/2020 and was modified on: 11/24/2020

## Introduction

This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to predict the customer retention preference of a commercial bank in China. The dataset is derived from an active competition on [Data Castle](https://www.dcjingsai.com/v2/cmptDetail.html?id=439). Additionally, this is also the course project of APSTA-GE 2401: Statistical Consulting Seminar at NYU Steinhardt.

### Overview

As we embracing the era of digital finance, many financial institutions adapt themselves to a data-based business mode by applying various data mining and machine learning techniques to their services. The Xiamen International Bank ("The Bank") has been heavily invested in data-driven financial services in recent years. As the bank expanding its business, it requires a better understanding of customer demands, especially revenue-related preference. Coordinated with Data Castle, the bank launched this competition, aiming to invite data scientists and statisticians to provide solutions regarding a real-world service problem: predicting customer retentions.

The task of this competition is to design and implement a supervised machine learning algorithm to predict whether or not customers will continue their businesses with the bank in the near future. Specifically, the bank is interested in learning about customer's [churn rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churn_rate) and the probability of changing their financial status. The purpose of predicting customer's retention probability is for precision marketing that prevents the bank from losing revenues.

To solve this problem, our team accomplished the following tasks:

1. Select and build a model combination that predicts retention probability based on the dataset.

2. Based on model results, present a professional business proposal for precision marketing.
